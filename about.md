Hi! My name is Albert Liu and I am an electrical engineer. I have had experiences in a variety of different settings from software development to hardware integration and testing. My passions lie with learning new technologies and abstracting the problem solving process across different stem domains. Due to the democratization of information from the internet as well as the ease of access to data from many different sources, my current interests lie in the machine learning / data science fields where I hope to be able apply my knowledge in an interdisciplinary fashion.

In my free time, I like to read up on new ideas that may help me solve more difficult problems in the future. This website serves as a form of notetaking for a few of the things that I have read up on and have felt were particularly useful. Feel free to comment / contact me if there was a particular post that was impactful to you.
